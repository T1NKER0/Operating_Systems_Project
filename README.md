The goal of this project was to design a simulation to demonstrate how the generic operating system schedules and handles the execution of processes and
how it also manages memory in a computerized system.

For process scheduling, the following algorithms were implemented:
- First-Come First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round-Robin (RR)

For memory management, the algorithms implemented are the following:
- First-In First-Out (FIFO)
- Least Recently Used (LRU)
- Optimal Algorithm

Linked lists were utilized to handle process and page / frame data in this project.
